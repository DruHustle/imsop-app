# Intelligent Multi-Cloud Supply Chain & Operations Platform (IMSOP)

This repository contains the documentation and source code for the **Intelligent Multi-Cloud Supply Chain & Operations Platform (IMSOP)**, a cloud-native platform for real-time supply chain visibility, predictive analytics, and intelligent automation.

## Project Overview

IMSOP is designed to address the challenges of modern supply chains by providing a unified, intelligent platform that integrates data from various sources, applies machine learning to generate predictive insights, and enables both automated and human-in-the-loop decision-making. The platform is built on a microservices architecture, leveraging a multi-cloud strategy across Azure and AWS to ensure high availability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.

For a detailed understanding of the project, please refer to the following documents:

*   **[Requirements Specification](./REQUIREMENTS.md):** Detailed functional and non-functional requirements for the platform.
*   **[Design Document](./DESIGN.md):** High-level system architecture, design principles, and technology stack.

## Getting Started

This project is organized into the following directories:

*   `/docs`: Contains all project documentation, including requirements, design, and architecture diagrams.
*   `/src`: Will contain the source code for the various microservices and frontend applications.
*   `/infra`: Will contain the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts for provisioning the cloud environment.

To get started with the project, you will need to have the following tools installed:

*   .NET Core SDK
*   Node.js and npm
*   Docker and Docker Compose
*   Terraform
*   Azure CLI
*   AWS CLI

Detailed setup instructions will be provided in the respective service directories as the project evolves.
